## Principles

The following outlines principles for **core** protocol funcitonality.

1. Immutable.
2. No Governance on the core protocol.
3. No Admin Keys on the core protocol.

## To-Do

Logic:

-   None at the momentðŸ™‚

Tests:

-   None at the momentðŸ™‚

Considerations:

-   [ ] Consider moving the protocol fee rate to the fee collector contract.

Cleanup:

-   [ ] Change `close()` to `reduce()` in `Position.sol`
-   [ ] Change all relevant test names related from `close` to `reduce`
-   [ ] Ensure terminology and variable references are consistent across all comments
-   [ ] Ensure full NatSpec comliance
